# Drivers Development Project

## Overview  
This project involves developing custom drivers from scratch for the **STM32F407 microcontroller**. The primary goal was to test communication protocols and deeply understand the architecture, including registers and low-level operations.

## Key Features  
- Implementation of UART, SPI, I2C drivers.
- Exploration of STM32 architecture and register-level programming.
- Testing communication protocols for real-world applications.

## Technologies Used  
- **STM32F407** MCU  
- **STM32CubeIDE**  
- **C/C++**

## Usage  
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azizbns0/Drivers-Development-Project.git
   cd Drivers-Development-Project
